## 🧠 Introduction

**Sarvwigyan (सर्वविज्ञान)** is a pioneering initiative to integrate **science, philosophy, artificial intelligence, quantum logic, and ancient wisdom** into a unified open-source ecosystem. This Python repository serves as the **technological backbone** of that dream — the engine behind the ideas.

Whether you're a student, philosopher, scientist, or developer, Sarvwigyan offers tools that **simulate intelligence, generate speech, understand Hindi**, and **build bridges between logic and soul**.

## 🔍 Vision

- 🧭 To make all knowledge — ancient and modern — accessible in the native languages of humanity.
- 🧠 To build a self-learning, evolving AI that understands meaning, context, and even human emotions.
- 🌐 To create a platform that merges Dharma, Science, Psychology, and Quantum Philosophy into one digital home.
- 🇮🇳 To empower Bharat and the world through open, free, and conscious computing.
